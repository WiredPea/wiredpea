GeSHi is a generic syntax highlighter, written in PHP. You simply
input the source code you wish to highlight with the language you
wish to use, and the output will be a file syntax highlighted to
XHTML standards.

For more information on how to use GeSHi, please consult the
documentation. If you got this readme from a GeSHi package, then
the documentation is available in the docs/ directory. Documentation
is also available at http://qbnz.com/highlighter/documentation.php
