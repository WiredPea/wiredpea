                          Version 1.0.2

- Putting a > inside an HTML comment will close the comment abruptly. There's nothing that
  can be done about this (at least in the 1.0.X series of GeSHi), but version 1.2 will fix
  this bug.
- Number highlighting is quite poor
- I'm not happy with URLS - there still could be extra bugs, and it's rather unflexible
  (see TODO for a possible fix)
- "Important" sections for some reason seem to have their spans added after every
  newline up until the next lexic, instead of stopping at the <END GeSHi> part.
