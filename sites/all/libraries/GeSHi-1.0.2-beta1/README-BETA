GeSHi 1.0.2 BETA1 Release
-------------------------

This release of GeSHi (1.0.2-beta1) is a TESTING/UNSTABLE release. You should not use this
in a live environment!

This beta has been released so that I can get feedback on the new features, and people can test
for bugs etc. etc. If you do find a bug, please submit it to the tracker at sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=114997&atid=670231

Or e-mail a report to me at oracle.shinoda@gmail.com

No more language files submitted after this has been released will be accepted for the 1.0.2
final release (though they will be included in the next stable release - 1.0.3 or 1.2.0). Neither
will new feature requests be incorporated into this version. However fixes to existing language
files are welcome.

Please read the documentation available in the docs/ directory before use! The main documentation
is incomplete at the moment, but will be completed for the final release.
